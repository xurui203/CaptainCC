#pragma mark run the very first scene (change to scene you want to launch)

// This message runs every time the CocosViewController storyboard is visited and the director has NO running scene.
// This message will also be sent if you popScene in cocosViewDidDisappear because that'll "end" the director.
-(void) runFirstScene

	[[CCDirector sharedDirector] runWithScene:[IntroLayer scene]];

	// Don't uncomment the two lines below if you want to:
	// a) return to the previously running scene in the state you left it
	// b) want to switch back to cocos2d as quickly as possible (all resources still being cached)
	// c) you have no reason to wipe all memory because the storyboards side of your app simply doesn't consume much memory
	
	// Ensure all additionally pushed scenes are popped, remaining only one scene on the stack, then pops the
	// remaining running scene - this will automatically and properly "end" the director and purge all caches!
	//[[CCDirector sharedDirector] popToRootScene];
	//[[CCDirector sharedDirector] popScene]; // this will "end" the director
	
	// DO NOT CALL CCDIRECTOR END MANUALLY HERE!! Uncomment the above lines and leave it up to cocos2d to end itself!

#pragma mark Autorotation overrides (uncomment & modify as needed)

// iOS 6 only: use this method to programmatically override the Summary pane supported interface orientations setting.

#pragma mark Memory Warning (Replace with more intelligent 'purge only unused resources' code)

-(void) didReceiveMemoryWarning
{
	// This is rarely a good idea, but it's cocos2d's brute-force default:
	[[CCDirector sharedDirector] purgeCachedData];
	
	// The better solution instead of purging is to *know* what resources you can free, and free only those.
	// Keep in mind that textures consume almost all of the memory, so focus on uncaching currently unused textures
	// sprite frames. Note that purgeCachedData does NOT purge the sprite frame cache!
	// You can practically ignore all the other caches because they contribute so little to overall memory usage.
	
	// Also consider that you may receive memory warnings WHILE you are loading textures, at which time cocos2d
	// will still consider them "unused" and purging caches or removing unused textures may remove exactly those
	// textures you just recently preloaded! This will cause the textures to be loaded again, but only when
	// they're actually being used as if they had never been preloaded.
